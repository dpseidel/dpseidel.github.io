Hi everyone, My name is Dana Paige Seidel. I respond to "Dana" and use she/her pronouns. In July 2019 I graduated from UC Berkeley with my PhD. My doctoral research focused on studying the movement of large mammals (e.g. zebra, elephants, and black rhino) and the spread of disease as a member of the [Getz Lab](https://nature.berkeley.edu/getzlab). Professionally, I fancy myself a bio-statistician, a data scientist, and a part-time educator. I currently work as a Senior Data Scientist at [Rivian](https://rivian.com). In my free time, I enjoy 
modern quilting, gardening, paddleboarding, backpacking and board games. For more information on my research or experience, mosey on over to my [Project Experience](https://www.danaseidel.com/research/) and [Resume](https://www.danaseidel.com/resume.pdf) tabs.
