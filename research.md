My doctoral research focused on the movement of large mammals and their diseases. My primary system of investigation is anthrax in populations of African elephant and zebra within Etosha National Park, Namibia. I've also explored the movement behavior of black rhinos and modeled the spatial risk 
of Chronic Wasting Disease in Albertan deer populations. In 2018 I built a [shiny 
app](https://github.com/dpseidel/ABCWD_Shiny) for the Government of Alberta to help managers regularly update their risk models with annually collected data. 
Code for all my published projects is available on my [github](https://github.com/dpseidel).

In summer 2018, I was delighted to intern with RStudio working on the tidyverse
team - you can read more about my experiences [here](https://www.danaseidel.com/2018-09-01-ATidySummer/).

From 2015-2017, I was a fellow with a NSF NRT project [Data Science for the 21st Century](http://ds421.berkeley.edu/) at Berkeley, training data scientists to analyse the social-environmental problems prompted by our rapidly changing global climate. I continued to [teach](https://dpseidel.github.io/teaching) with the program through May 2018.

In the summer of 2016, I worked as a Quantitative Analyst Intern with the Geo Data Analytics team at Google Maps. It was a great opportunity to apply my spatial statistics expertise and hone my data science skills in a totally different realm.

From Fall 2011 - 2014,  my masters research focused on elk populations in SW Alberta with [Dr. Mark Boyce](https://www.ualberta.ca/science/about-us/contact-us/faculty-directory/mark-boyce). I continue to maintain connections at the University of Alberta through a side project working to develop a system for updating risk maps of Chronic Wasting Disease.
