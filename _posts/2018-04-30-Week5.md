Here again with some neat results from TidyTuesday! This time I chose to explore
`plotly` and `mapview` for interactive spatial graphics. Enjoy!


## Load the libraries and data

``` r
#devtools::install_github("jjchern/usmapdata")
library(usmapdata)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)

acs <- read_csv("../data/week5_acs2015_county_data.csv")
```

# Playing with census data

This week I’m shamelessly taking my dear friend Sara’s (@sastoudt) Week5
function and doing a few small edits to adapt it for tidy evaluation.
Shout out to the original author @AidoBo, from whose code she originally
adapted her functions. I’ve been trying to teach myself how to program
with dplyr for several months, but it hasn’t quite stuck yet. I do a lot
of googling and given how fast the development is on this side, I’m
never sure if my answers are the current best practice. But today all I
ended up needed was a simple `rlang::quo_text` call and the `aes_string`
functionality in ggplot2.

I also did some googling to adapt the base map to include Alaska and
Hawaii since there seemed no reason to throw out perfectly good census
data. It’s unfortunate the maps package doesn’t seem to include the
non-contiguous states but there are a number of packages trying to fill
this gap `usdata`, `usmapdata`, and `fiftystater` to name a few.

counties <- usmapdata::county %>% mutate(CensusId = as.integer(id))
all_county <- left_join(counties, acs)

ggplot() +
  geom_map(data = all_county, map = all_county,
           aes(x = long, y = lat, map_id = id, fill = Employed),
           color="black",  size=0.1) +
  coord_map("albers", lat0 = 30, lat1 = 40) +
  ggthemes::theme_map()

I’ve played a little with `plotly` and would love to make its `tooltip`
columns dynamically programmed but that might be a bit much for me right
now. Instead, I thought I would play with `sf` and `mapview` a bit.

I’d still like to make this interactive – so you can chose a new column
to display from a dropdown… but the only way I can think to do that is
with a shiny app. I wonder if that is doable in `leaflet` or `mapview`
proper. For now, I can add them individuals as layers and “burst”… then
they are interactive in the layer menu and can be turned on or off. Not
perfect but a neat option when you don’t want to build out a full custom
webapp.

``` r
library(mapview)

lower48_sf <- sf::st_as_sf(maps::map("county", plot = FALSE, fill = TRUE)) %>% 
  left_join(all_county %>% 
              mutate(ID= paste(tolower(State), tolower(County),sep=",")) %>% 
              select(-c(1:6)) %>% distinct)


m <- mapview(lower48_sf,
             zcol = c("IncomePerCap", "Poverty", "Hispanic", 
                      "White", "Men", "Women"),
        burst = T,
        hide = T, 
        legend = T, 
        homebutton = F)

m
```
