Last month,  my colleague Eric and I were invited to lead a workshop teaching movement
ecology methods in R! This week I finally got a proper website built to show it off!
I hope others find the resources useful. It was an amazing opportunity and I had 
a wonderful time preparing and presenting these materials. 
See our [website](https://www.danaseidel.com/MovEco-R-Workshop) for
more information and all the materials!
